## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is developed using **React** along with several UI libraries and tools for styling, routing, and data management.

### 📌 React Fundamental Concepts Used

- **Components** – Reusable building blocks of the UI.
- **JSX** – JavaScript syntax extension for writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
- **Props** – Used to pass data from one component to another.
- **State (`useState`)** – Manages component-specific data that affects rendering.
- **Lifecycle Methods (`useEffect`)** – Special methods/hooks that run at different stages of a component's life.
- **React Router** – Enables client-side navigation without page reloads.
- **Event Handling** – Managing user interactions like clicks, inputs, and form submissions.
- **Conditional Rendering** – Rendering elements based on certain conditions.
- **List Rendering (`map`)** – Efficiently rendering multiple elements from an array.
- **Keys in Lists** – Unique identifiers for list items to improve performance.
- **URL Parameters (`useParams`)** – Extracting dynamic values from URLs.
- **`useParams`** – Hook to access route parameters.
- **`useNavigate`** – Hook for programmatic navigation.
- **`useLocation`** – Hook to access the current URL location.
- **Dynamic Page Title (`useEffect`)** – Changing the document title based on the current page.

### 📌 State Management

- **Context API (`createContext`, `useContext`)** is used for managing global state efficiently.
